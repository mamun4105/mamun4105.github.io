______________________________

This project involves quantification and optimization of nature's contribution to people. We conduct global-scale land use and management optimization of economic outcomes (such as agriculture, forestry, and grazing) and environmental outcomes (such as carbon sequestration, water quality, and biodiversity). Our spatial optimization and analysis are at the 300m resolution. There are several funding agencies involved in this larger project including The World Bank and Microsoft. 

The outcome of this project is several peer review articles and reports:
