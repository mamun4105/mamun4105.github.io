______________________________

This collection of projects involves making decisions from scientific discovery. These projects are funded by different agencies such as US Department of Defense (DOD), Minnesota Government, and US Forest Services. I am in charge of study the cost-benefit analysis and life-cylce analysis.

The Projects include:

1) The economics of protection of manoomin (wild rice) waters: quantifying tradeoffs among industry and ecosystem service provision

2) Woody Biomass Biochar as a Fossil Coke Substitute in the Reduction of Lead Oxide

4) Green Solar Cells from a Minnesota Natural Resource

5) LIfe cycle analysis of forest management practices
