Nature provides multiple benefits to humans (also known as ecosystem services). Often policymakers make decisions without considering a holistic decision matrix. My research provides a basis for informed sciences-based decisions. Most of my work falls into forest ecosystem services. I use global-scale geospatial data and deep-learning computer vision algorithms to understand forest stressors. In addition, I estimate global scale forest economic returns.

The tentative output from the project is several peer review articles:

1. Mamun et al "Forest Loss detection using semantic segmentation" (Journal: TBD)
2. Mamun, S. Polasky, S., Shohngen, B., and Smith, J. "Global current and potential forestry return maps" (preparing for Forest Policy and Economics) [[Data and Code]]()
3. Mamun, S., McIntosh, C., and Polasky, S. "Forest Ecosystem Services Valuation: A Choice Experiment Approach" (preparing for Society and Natural Resources)
